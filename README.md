## **⚡ RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) minimal implementation**


A RAG application combines retrieval and generation to give accurate, context-based answers.

🔹 Workflow



1.   **Indexing**
  * **Load**: Import data with Document Loaders.

  * **Split**: Break documents into smaller chunks.

   * **Store**: Save chunks in a Vector Store using embeddings.
2.   **Retrieval & Generation**
* **Retrieve**: Fetch relevant chunks for a user query.

* **Generate**: An LLM creates an answer using the query + retrieved data.

* ### 🔗 LangChain

LangChain is a framework that makes it easier to build applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It connects LLMs with external data sources and tools, enabling **context-aware** and more powerful AI apps.


 ✨ **Key Features**
- **Components** → Abstractions for LLMs, retrievers, parsers, etc.  
- **Chains** → Combine components into sequences or graphs for complex workflows.  
- **Agents** → Let LLMs interact with their environment and decide actions.  
- **Indexing** → Load, structure, and query external data.  
- **LangServe** → Deploy LangChain apps as APIs.

🛠️ **LangSmith**

**LangSmith** is a platform for building **production-grade LLM applications**.  
It allows you to **monitor, evaluate, and debug** your applications so you can ship faster and with confidence.  



✨ **Key Capabilities**
- **Monitoring** → Track application performance in real time.  
- **Evaluation** → Assess outputs for quality and reliability.  
- **Debugging** → Inspect inputs, outputs, and intermediate steps.  
- **Optimization** → Continuously improve your LLM pipelines.

### LangGraph
LangGraph provides both low-level primitives and high-level prebuilt components for building agent-based applications.


***Agent loop: the LLM selects tools and uses their outputs to fulfill a user request.***
